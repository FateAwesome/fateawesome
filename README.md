Subject: URGENT: Investigation of Potential Data Breach - Action Required

Dear Team,

I'm writing regarding a potential data breach that requires immediate attention. We've identified a publicly accessible Google Drive containing sensitive vehicle and customer information that may be connected to Kotak.

Our preliminary analysis indicates:
- The Excel files contain auction-related data including vehicle registration numbers, engine numbers, chassis details, and customer personal information.
- While Kotak isn't explicitly mentioned in the files, some vehicles are listed as "Kotak repossessed vehicles" on platforms like OLX, suggesting a connection.
- References to "SuperBids" with contact details appear in the data, potentially indicating third-party involvement.

To address this situation, please take the following actions immediately:

1. Validate whether this data belongs to Kotak or any affiliated entities.

2. Identify the owner of the Google Drive - determine if it belongs to Kotak or an authorized third-party vendor.

3. Disable public sharing of the Google Drive immediately to prevent further unauthorized access.

4. Determine when the drive was first made publicly accessible and who has viewed or downloaded the data.

5. Prepare for potential data breach notifications to affected customers and regulatory authorities if ownership is confirmed.

6. Investigate the relationship between Kotak and "SuperBids" to determine if they are an authorized vendor.

7. Conduct a review of data sharing practices with third parties if the connection is confirmed.

Time is of the essence in addressing this matter. Please let me know if you need any additional information about the discovered link to assist with the investigation.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this critical issue.

Regards,
[Your Name]
