Discover how to build a simple **Malware Analysis Lab**, with all the **Precautions** offcourse.

<!--more-->

## Preface

**Malware analysis** the keyword itself is very fascinating. learning and mastering this craft can lead to a rewarding career, but it's a painful profession that may give you sleepless nights, especially when it comes to **Reverse Engineering**.

Anyway, we are not here to talk about that, and if you are here somehow I assume you are a beginner in this field like me **:)** or someone who got attracted by the keywords and is here to explore what I've all about. let's jump to the topic.

## Requirements

As the Tile of this article says **Simple Malware Analysis lab**, should be simple enough to build, also without losing the bucks. I assume you have a computer already, probably with a good configuration than mine, that you can use to host some of the virtual machines going forward, if not so or you want to use a computer dedicated to Malware Analysis separate from your Personal Computer, you can take a look at my own system configuration dedicated for this purpose as a given blow, that works for me hope it'll work for you as well

- CPU : Intel Core i5
- RAM : 16GB DDR4
- Storage : 500 GB, SSD
- OS : Windows 10
- Internet connection

{{< admonition note "Ready to go Virtual" >}}
You might need a virtualization software Probable Virtual Box or VMware to host the virtual machines for testing the samples,

Unless you want to test the Samples on the host machine itself, And if that's the thought racing in your mind, I advise you to Read the Precaution section before even starting.

{{< admonition tip "My Case" >}}
With the configuration given above, I'm able to host two Virtual Machines on thcomputer, that run smoothly.

## Setting up the Lab environment

### Things to take care

There are a few things we need to take care to achieve successfully analyze the Malware,

- Make the virtual Machines as real as possible
  - Use of 8 GB of RAM and Two CPUs
  - Install common software such as Office, Chrome, Adobe, etc.
  - Create multiple files and open them such as word documents, excel sheets, text documents, etc.
- Tricking the Malware thinking that it's online
  - FakeNet
  - INetSim
- Install Operating System Patches if any
- Turn off Antivirus/Defender on that Lab Machine

{{< admonition tip "Be careful with Virtual Machine tools" >}}
Do not Install VM Guest tools
