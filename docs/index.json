Anyway, we are not here to talk about that, and if you are here somehow I assume you are a beginner in this field like me :) or someone who got attracted by the keywords and is here to explore what I’ve all about. let’s jump to the topic.

I assume you have a computer already, probably with a good configuration than mine, that you can use to host some of the virtual machines going forward, if not so or you want to use a computer dedicated to Malware Analysis separate from your Personal Computer, you can take a look at my own system configuration dedicated for this purpose as a given blow, that works for me hope it’ll work for you as well CPU : Intel Core i5 RAM : 16GB DDR4 Storage : 500 GB, SSD OS : Windows 10 Internet connection Ready to go Virtual\rYou might need a virtualization software Probable Virtual Box or VMware to host the virtual machines for testing the samples, Unless you want to test the Samples on the host machine itself, And if that’s the thought racing in your mind, I advise you to Read the Precaution section before even starting.

Where your fate is determined by a mere glimpse of your shadow. You are scrapped out, thrown to the dust, reduced to rags, and sorted into the queue of filthy, unworthy lives as they classify… Why? You don’t wear an appearance; you don’t have one. My heart plunges, My soul is crushed with grief; My friend! But the truth is, you’re not qualified, unfit for the league, and you are despised. In a world where you are accepted to be a wolf in a sheep’s coat, but killed for being one. How would you stand up, and showcase what you have to offer? You are not consulted; you are not considered. Ah.. Those unaffordable appearances, I can’t have any, I hate. I wonder, yet I am desperate.. hmm… Sometimes. You’re nothing more than a sliver of glass, with everything visible through, but you. Yet, they are conscious of your presence and know how frail you are. True, I don’t have the appearance of a qualified. I’m a sheer glass, brittle, fragile I’m. Wonder; I’ve survived so far? Defying the odds, making a room… short-term… Maybe? Will it be shattered? Will it be restored?.. Again, who knows? making me less invisible; every time, that’s for sure. With this moving earth, mustn’t I move forward? continue to advance, keep rolling, surpassing every goal I have ever achieved, every pit stop I have reached, running breathlessly..Crawling, creeping on my stomach, sometimes..yeah..Sometimes. Hell of a journey it’s been, should I call it a success? an achievement? Or perhaps a calamity? That I chose deliberately. At the very least, to console the soul that I shall refer to as mine, a dubious claim!, I’m allowing myself to label this as an accomplishment! To appease the greedy little fool, imprisoned in my skull and ever demanding! …Stop! Right there, what the hell are you doing, lad? That’s enough! Enjoy the success, and stay! You’ve earned it, haven’t you? Guess says who? And to the people, what do I bring to the table? Wisdom,Skills no? Oh, all right… mm… labor, hard work.. will… honesty? C’mon, be honest for once, lad. “The wisdom”, a Jewel I’m not supposed to have possession of. is abundant all around! Business of aristocrats, over and above my status. Guess what? I can work like a jackass; it seems like labor is right on; will, however, is not. I am goddamn enslaved to my desires. I believe that sums up the “Labor” or, shall we say, nicely, “hard work” [remember? To appease the greedy little..] Nevertheless, who doesn’t do that? In their own ways. A donkey does, until his last breath… Anyway, there’s no shame in working hard, not at all, as long as you are willing to, and it’s not forced. But is that why I survived? Don’t you think? Am I not a tool to be utilized, to plow, sow, reap, and most importantly, to SURVIVE? By this very own world, for this very own world, and yet I’m disgusted. Oh..I’m paid, though; yeah.. With scraps from my own life.
