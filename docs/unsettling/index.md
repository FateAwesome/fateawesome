### **I'm a donkey, as you see me fit!**

_"All that glisters is not gold; Often have you heard that told:_
_Many a man his life has sold But my outside to behold:_
_Gilded tombs do worms enfold.."_ ― William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice

In a world where one is judged by one's appearance, where qualification takes precedence over qualities. Where your fate is determined by a mere glimpse of your shadow.

You are scrapped out, thrown to the dust, reduced to rags, and sorted into the queue of filthy, unworthy lives as they classify... Why? You don't wear an **appearance;** you don't have one. My heart plunges, My soul is crushed with grief; My friend! But the truth is, **you're not qualified,** unfit for the league, and you are despised. In a world where you are accepted to be a wolf in a sheep's coat, but killed for being one.

How would you stand up, and showcase what you have to offer? You are not consulted; you are not considered. Ah.. Those unaffordable appearances, I can't have any, I hate. I wonder, yet I am desperate.. hmm… Sometimes.

# **You're nothing more than a sliver of glass, with everything visible through, but you.** Yet, they are conscious of your presence and know how frail you are.

True, I don't have the appearance of a qualified. I'm a sheer glass, brittle, fragile I'm. Wonder; I've survived so far? Defying the odds, making a room… short-term… Maybe? Will it be shattered? Will it be restored?.. Again, who knows? making me less invisible; every time, that's for sure.

With this moving earth, mustn't I move forward? continue to advance, keep rolling, surpassing every goal I have ever achieved, every pit stop I have reached, running breathlessly..Crawling, creeping on my stomach, sometimes..yeah..Sometimes. Hell of a journey it's been, should I call it a success? an achievement? Or perhaps a **calamity?** That I chose deliberately.

At the very least, to console the soul that I shall refer to as mine, **a dubious claim!**, I’m allowing myself to label this as an accomplishment! To appease the greedy little fool, imprisoned in my skull and ever demanding!

...Stop! Right there, what the hell are you doing, lad? That's enough! Enjoy the success, and stay! You've earned it, haven't you? Guess says who?

And to the people, what do I bring to the table? Wisdom,Skills no? Oh, all right… mm… labor, hard work.. will… honesty? C'mon, be honest for once, lad.

**"The wisdom"**, a Jewel I'm not supposed to have possession of.  is abundant all around! Business of aristocrats, over and above my status.
Guess what? I can work like a jackass; it seems like **labor** is right on; **will**, however, is not. _I am goddamn enslaved to my desires._

I believe that sums up the "Labor" or, shall we say, nicely, "hard work" _[remember? To appease the greedy little..]_ Nevertheless, who doesn't do that? In their own ways. A donkey does, until his last breath… Anyway, **there's no shame in working hard, not at all, as long as you are willing to, and it's not forced.**
But is that why I survived? Don't you think? **Am I not a tool to be utilized, to plow, sow, reap, and most importantly, to SURVIVE?** By this very own world, for this very own world, and yet I'm disgusted. Oh..I'm paid, though; yeah.. With scraps from my own life.

### And, Yes! from my appearances, ladies, and gentlemen. Perhaps **I'm a donkey! As you see me fit.**
